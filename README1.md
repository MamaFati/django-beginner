### What-is-Django

## My process

1. To start a django project you first need a virtal enviroment which helps in storing our dependencies we need for our project

```
  python -m venv venv
```

2. Activate virtual environment

```
   venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install Django

```
  pip install django
```

4. Start project by using this command

```
   django-admin startproject (projectname)
```

5. Start server by typing

```
  python manage.py runserver
```

6. Django consist of projects and multiple apps, create your app

```
   django-admin startapp (appName)
```

7. In your project folder there'sa file called setting.py,
   open it and navigate Installed_apps and add the name of your app

8. In your project folder you have a file called urls.py and in your apps folder you will have views.py
   these files works as for examples: when you go to a restaurant you make your order (url) and the waiter will deliver
   what you ordered (views), That's how this concept works in django.

   8.i. Open veiws.py

   ```
    from django.shortcuts import render,HttpResponse


      # Create your views here.

      def index(request):
      return HttpResponse("Hello world, i'm soo exited")
   ```

   8.ii. open urls.py

   ```
    from django.urls import path
    from my_app.views import index,about,hello,my_age


    # from my_app.views import about

    urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('',index),
    ]
   ```
